    # Related to this patch https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=673135
    # However, it was rejected by upstream. Homebrew decided to keep their own
    # copy ( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/patches/59e4d32/glib/hardcoded-paths.diff ).
    # We are essentially using that copy, but with some tweaks. Info at the link below.
